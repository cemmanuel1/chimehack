# Techwomen.us

#### Description
Created during the 2 day #Chimehack to support the need of NGO Vital Voices.

Women 2 Watch creates a social network for women doing amazing things. They'll be able to share current news, social impacts, videos, twitter feed and more. Everything you need to inspire our next great women leaders.

Once signed up, data is automatically updated from current news and the women's other social media; freeing up time to go be leaders and not maintain a site.



#### About its Development
Built with Ruby on Rails & Javascript.

Profile data is dynamically aggregated from Wikipedia, Guardian, Twitter, Youtube, and Google search history APIs.
